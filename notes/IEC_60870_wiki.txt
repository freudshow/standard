In electrical engineering and power system automation, the International Electrotechnical Commission 60870 standards define systems used for telecontrol (supervisory control and data acquisition). Such systems are used for controlling electric power transmission grids and other geographically widespread control systems. By use of standardized protocols, equipment from many different suppliers can be made to interoperate. IEC standard 60870 has six parts, defining general information related to the standard, operating conditions, electrical interfaces, performance requirements, and data transmission protocols. The 60870 standards are developed by IEC Technical Committee 57 (Working Group 03).

IEC 60870-5[edit]
Main article: IEC 60870-5
IEC 60870 part 5, known as Transmission protocols, [1] provides a communication profile for sending basic telecontrol messages between two systems, which uses permanent directly connected data circuits between the systems. The IEC TC 57 WG3 have developed a protocol standard for telecontrol, teleprotection, and associated telecommunications for electric power systems. The result of this work is IEC 60870-5. Five documents specify the base IEC 60870-5:

IEC 60870-5-1 Transmission Frame Formats
IEC 60870-5-2 Data Link Transmission Services
IEC 60870-5-3 General Structure of Application Data
IEC 60870-5-4 Definition and Coding of Information Elements
IEC 60870-5-5 Basic Application Functions
IEC 60870-5-6 Guidelines for conformance testing for the IEC 60870-5 companion standards
IEC TS 60870-5-7 Security extensions to IEC 60870-5-101 and IEC 60870-5-104 protocols (applying IEC 62351)
The IEC TC 57 has also generated companion standards:

IEC 60870-5-101 Transmission Protocols - companion standards especially for basic telecontrol tasks
IEC 60870-5-102 Transmission Protocols - Companion standard for the transmission of integrated totals in electric power systems (this standard is not widely used)
IEC 60870-5-103 Transmission Protocols - Companion standard for the informative interface of protection equipment
IEC 60870-5-104 Transmission Protocols - Network access for IEC 60870-5-101 using standard transport profiles
IEC TS 60870-5-601 Transmission protocols - Conformance test cases for the IEC 60870-5-101 companion standard
IEC TS 60870-5-604 Conformance test cases for the IEC 60870-5-104 companion standard
IEC 60870-5-101/102/103/104 are companion standards generated for basic telecontrol tasks, transmission of integrated totals, data exchange from protection equipment & network access of IEC101 respectively.

IEC 60870-6[edit]
